# Roadmap.sh Backend Projects 🚀

Welcome to my collection of backend projects completed from the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend) backend developer track.

This repository serves as a centralized workspace, housing various CLI tools, APIs, and backend services built to strengthen my server-side architecture and development skills.

## 📂 Projects Portfolio

Here is a log of the projects I have built, in order of completion:

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Across this repository, you will find a variety of backend tools, languages, and core concepts, currently featuring:

- **TypeScript / Node.js:** For building robust, strongly-typed server-side scripts.
- **Core Node Modules:** Extensive use of `fs` and `path` for low-level file system operations without external libraries.
- **CLI Architecture:** Handling `process.argv` and command routing.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

To explore or test any of these projects locally, clone this repository to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pamodmalith/roadmap-backend-projects.git
cd roadmap-backend-projects
```

Then, navigate to the specific project folder you want to run. Each project contains its own isolated environment. For example:

```bash
cd task-tracker-cli
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

(Note: Check the individual README.md inside each project folder for specific setup instructions and command usage.)

This repository is continuously updated as I progress through the backend roadmap.
